- Establish API client layer and error handling patterns.

## Deliverables

- Frontend app scaffold integrated with backend API.
- Design system documentation with component usage examples.
- Standard loading/empty/error states.
- Accessibility baseline (keyboard navigation, labels, contrast checks).

## Acceptance Criteria

- UI works on desktop and mobile sizes.
- Core navigation is discoverable within 2 clicks for key workflows.
- Components are reused consistently across pages.
- API errors are presented in actionable user language.

## Quality Gates

- Component tests for critical UI primitives.
- Basic end-to-end smoke tests for routing and API connectivity.
- UX checklist completed for accessibility and responsiveness.
